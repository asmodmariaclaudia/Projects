            Two sides to a story but they never tell my side
            Never been the kinda guy to stay inside the guidelines
            I know I'm the bad guy, I don't gotta ask why
            If you try step to me, it'll be the last time
            I got dirt on my name, six feet in the ground
            I got people in my past try bringin' me down
            Say I'm losin' my mind, I don't wanna be found
            Grew up in the shadow but I know they watchin' me now

            Paranoia, on the go, I'm moving silent (let's go)
            Pull up on ya, I got trouble right behind me (let's go)
            Bite the bullet, suit and tie, the silver linin'
            I'm-i'm-i'm-i'm gonna show you how to crash a party

            Every time you pop off, they hopin' that you fall hard
            They prayin' for the death of a rockstar
            Everybody hatin' ever since you got more
            They prayin' for the death of a rockstar
            Ooh, they love it when you lost, boy
            Now the low life at the top floor
            Everybody hatin' ever since you got more
            They prayin' for the death of a rockstar

            They talk about me, I forget to listen
            At least I get the recognition
            Heavyweight, I pull up on you with the repetition
            You in the pit, it's not no exhibition
            Oh, they big mad, I'm the big boss
            Talk a big game, take a big loss
            Growin' up, I was the problem that they didn't solve
            I'm the piece that wouldn't fit inside the jigsaw
            I got a lotta punch lines and a quick jab
            I'm runnin' straight through, I don't gotta zig-zag
            I got a heavy heart, it's hard to lift that
            From the cradle to the grave, never changed, make 'em dig that

            Paranoia, on the go, I'm moving silent (let's go)
            Pull up on ya, I got trouble right behind me (let's go)
            Bite the bullet, suit and tie, the silver linin'
            I'm-i'm-i'm-i'm gonna show you how to crash a party

            Every time you pop off, they hopin' that you fall hard
            They prayin' for the death of a rockstar
            Everybody hatin' ever since you got more
            They prayin' for the death of a rockstar
            Ooh, they love it when you lost, boy
            Now the low life at the top floor
            Everybody hatin' ever since you got more
            They prayin' for the death of a rockstar

            They wanna kiss me long good night with a rose
            Hoping that the Eiffel falls, of course
            You don't understand the life we chose
            (On life support, life goes)
            I need my silence, my privacy so I can heal
            And even rockstars got feelings that they feel
            In reality, this just repeats like a drill
            Always, oh-oh, oh-oh

            Every time you pop off, they hopin' that you fall hard
            They prayin' for the death of a rockstar (yeah, yeah)
            Everybody hatin' ever since you got more
            They prayin' for the death of a rockstar
            Ooh, they love it when you lost, boy (when you lost)
            Now the low life at the top floor (top floor)
            Everybody hatin' ever since you got more (ever since you got more)
            They prayin' for the death of a rockstar
            Pop off, they hopin' that you fall hard
            They prayin' for the death of a rockstar
            Everybody hatin' ever since you got more (ever since you got more)
            They prayin' for the death of a rockstar
